Landing page &amp; product pitch for RoofDocs — a SaaS platform that automates construction compliance documents for roofing contractors in the US.

# RoofDocs 🏗️📄  
**Construction Compliance, Automated**

RoofDocs is a SaaS concept focused on automating construction permit and compliance documentation for roofing contractors in the United States.

This repository contains the **landing page / product pitch** used to present the idea, market problem, solution, and business model.

---

## 🚧 The Problem

Roofing contractors in the US face a complex and fragmented permit process:

- Each city and county has different rules
- Manual paperwork leads to frequent errors
- Rejected permits delay projects
- Contractors pay **$250–$400 per project** to third parties just to handle documentation

This process is slow, expensive, and inefficient.

---

## 💡 The Solution

RoofDocs is a **compliance automation platform** that:

- Stores contractor data once (licenses, insurance, company info)
- Generates city-specific documentation automatically
- Prevents common errors and rejections
- Exports ready-to-submit PDFs
- Reduces permit preparation from hours to minutes

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. Register your company information
2. Create a construction project
3. Automatically generate required documents
4. Download PDFs and submit to the city

---

## 🎯 Target Market

- Roofing contractors (initial focus)
- United States construction market
- Recurring, mandatory compliance needs
- High willingness to pay due to clear ROI

## 💰 Business Model
